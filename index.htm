<strong>How to host a website on GitHub Pages for free also using your 
registered domain name</strong><br />
<br />
Hello, World!<br />
<br />
After being absent for ~10 years from anything related to website design and/or 
hosting I'm exited to be back!<br />
Still having had registered a domain name for years, the initial question was 
were/how to host a simple website for free in 2024?<br />
<br />
I figured out that GitHub via the so called GitHub Pages basically provides you 
a free webserver,<br />
which can be used to upload *.HTML files to the web to be accessible via a 
GitHub based URL.<br />
It is also possible to map this respective GitHub based URL to your registered 
domain.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here is a short step-by-step guide how how to proceed:<br />
<br />
1.) If not existing yet create a simple website called index.html.<br />
This can be either done via *.TXT editor like Notepad or if you are not familiar 
with this topic by using a template.<br />
<br />
2.) Open GitHub (https://github.com/) and if not existing create a GitHub 
account for free.<br />
<br />
3.) Once you have logged in to GitHub under the "Start writing code" section 
enter a name of your website project under "Repository name *" (=for example 
"website").<br />
Then on the radio buttons below select "Public" and click the "Create a new 
repository" button.<br />
<br />
4.) On the next page click on the "uploading an existing file" link and uploade 
your "index.html" website via drag and drop.<br />
Afterwards click the "Commit changes" button.<br />
<br />
5.) On the top left corner select "Settings", then go to "Pages", within the 
"Branch" section change from "None" to "Main" and click on the "Save" button.<br />
<br />
6.) Your website based on the uploaded "index.html" file should be available via 
the URL shown under "Your site is live at" section.<br />
(Note: If you try to open the website via this URL it might take a couple of 
seconds until minutes until it got published accordingly!) <br />
<br />
<br />
Optional:<br />
In case instead of the default URL (=https://*.github.io/*/ ) you have already 
or want to use a registered domain please follow these steps:<br />
